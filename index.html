            <h3>Importance of Safety Gear</h3>

            <p>To improve motorcycle safety many countries mandate the wearing
            of personal protective equipment such as protective clothing and
            helmets. Protective clothing may include certain types of jackets,
            gloves, boots, and pants. Jackets meant for motorcyclists are
            typically made of leather or specialized man-made fabrics like
            cordura or Kevlar. These jackets typically include heavy padding on
            the elbow, spine, and shoulder regions. Gloves are generally made
            of leather or Kevlar and some include carbon fiber knuckle
            protection. Boots, especially those for sport riding, include
            reinforcement and plastic caps on the ankle and toe areas. Pants
            are usually leather, cordura, or Kevlar. Except for helmets, none
            of these items are required by law in any state in the USA, or in
            any part of the UK but are recommended by many of those who
            ride.</p>

            <p>"Off road" riders wear a range of plastic armour to protect
            against injury from falling off, hitting other riders and bikes,
            debris kicked up from the rear wheel of leading bikes, and from
            running into track barriers protecting the public. This armour
            protects the extremities from breakage and dislocation and the back
            and chest from strain and broken bones. Although fairly efficient,
            it is of course not always completely effective. Many riders wear
            "roost protectors" designed specifically to protect against painful
            debris from other bikes, but are of no use in a fall or
            collision.</p>
