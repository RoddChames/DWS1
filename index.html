		<p>
		This group is for those who want to get out and ride with others who share the joy of cruising around the city on two wheels. We are a growing establishment from Southeastern Virginia & Eastern North Carolina and we are continuously looking for ways to impact our communities in a positive manner.

To be a part of this fine establishment, you should have a motorcycle or be in the process of obtaining a motorcycle to ride.  All types of motorcycle and all experience levels are welcomed to come out and at least experience what we are all about here at Knight Hawks MC. If you are just getting started with your riding experience do not worry, because you will find plenty of support and encouragement from our members. 

Do not be afraid to ask us for help. We have all been there! It is all about 
enjoying your own ride while staying safe. We will not leave anyone behind. 

<strong>Join us today!!!</strong> We promise, you will find a group of amazing people who all love the open road.
