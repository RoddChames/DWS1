            <h2>Aviation Ordnanceman Rating<br>
            (March 2, 1926-Present)</h2>

            <p>The Navy's Aviation Ordnance rating really began on April 9,
            1915 when a Chief Gunners Mate and a Chief Turret Captain, along
            with several other mechanics, were sent to Pensacola, Florida to
            work on what would be the beginning of aircraft armament and
            ordnance systems.</p>

            <p>The Navy accepted its first aircraft, a Curtiss Triad
            (Hydroplane), on August 9, 1911. Early bombing tests were held in
            January and February of 1913, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in July
            1914 at Indian Head, Maryland. Twenty-two months later, in May
            1916, the development of a gyroscopic bomb-sight was initiated. On
            April 6, 1917, at which time the United States entered into World
            War One, the inventory of the fledging air arm consisted of the
            following: 45 seaplanes, six flying boats, three land planes, and
            one airship. By September, 1917 two types of bombs were in service
            with a third type coming into production, weighing 163, 270, and
            216 pounds respectively. Successful tests of machine guns were
            conducted between January and May, 1918 at Pensacola, Florida.</p>

            <p>In March of 1918, the Aviation Ordnance (AVORD) sub-section in
            the Bureau of Ordnance, became a separate unit. Previously it
            served as a division of the Surface Gun Mount section, dating back
            to the early months of the war. As a separate group, they were
            given cognizance over the procurement and technical aspects of
            machine guns, including mounts, sights, fittings and ammunition.
            Other aviation ordnance items falling within AVORD cognizance in
            1918 were larger caliber guns, bombs, bomb racks, bomb sights,
            pyrotechnic signaling devices, air launched torpedoes, aircraft
            torpedo launching equipment, and training devices which include
            miniature practice bombs.</p>

            <p>The Aviation Ordnanceman rating was established at all four
            petty officer grades of Chief, First, Second and Third Class on
            March 2, 1926 as a rating within the Aviation Branch. The Aviation
            Ordnanceman rating was filled initially from qualified personnel
            serving primarily with the ratings of Gunner's Mate and Torpedoman
            (assigned to aviation). The Aviation Ordnanceman specialty mark, a
            winged flaming spherical shell, was incorporated into Uniform
            Regulations in January 1927.</p>
