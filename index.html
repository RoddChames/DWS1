		<h1>Knight Hawks Motorcycle Club</h1>
		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p>This group is for those who want to get out and ride with others who share the joy of cruising around the city on two wheels. We are a growing establishment from Southeastern Virginia & Eastern North Carolina and we are continuously looking for ways to impact our communities in a positive manner. </br>

To be a part of this group, you should be female with a motorcycle or in the process of getting her 'M' class and a motorcycle to ride.  All bikes and all experience levels are welcome. You'll find plenty of support from members if you're just getting started. 

Don't be afraid to ask us for help. We've all been there! It's all about 
enjoying your own ride while staying safe. We don't leave anyone behind. 

Join us today, and RSVP to a meetup right away. I promise, you'll find a group of amazing women, all in love with the open road. 

Welcome to Tidewater Ladies on Wheels. 

We ride our own!   </p>
